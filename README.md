# Student Performance Index Prediction

## Introduction
The Student Performance dataset provides information about various factors influencing a student's academic performance. The dataset contains six columns:

- **Hours of Studied** - The number of hours a student dedicates to studying.
- **Previous Year Question Score (PYQ Score)** - The score obtained by solving previous year’s question papers.
- **Extracurricular Activities** - Participation in activities beyond academics.
- **Sleep Hours** - The average number of hours a student sleeps per day.
- **Number of Sample Paper Questions Solved** - The count of practice questions attempted by the student.
- **Performance Index** - The target variable representing the overall performance of the student.

This dataset is designed for analyzing and predicting the impact of various factors on student performance. It can be used for developing machine learning models to understand patterns and derive insights that can help in improving academic outcomes.

## Objectives
- Analyze the relationship between study habits, extracurricular activities, and performance.
- Evaluate the impact of sleep hours and preparation levels on academic outcomes.
- Develop regression models to predict the **Performance Index** using the other features.
- Compare different models and identify the most accurate one for performance prediction.
- Create a tool or function to predict student performance for new data points.

## Insights
- **Impact of Study Hours:** Analyze how the number of hours studied correlates with the performance index and identify optimal study hours.
- **Importance of Practice:** Examine the relationship between the number of sample paper questions solved and performance index.
- **Role of Extracurricular Activities:** Explore the impact of extracurricular activities on performance, highlighting the importance of balance.
- **Effect of Sleep Hours:** Investigate how sleep patterns influence academic outcomes.
- **Significance of PYQ Scores:** Determine the impact of familiarity with previous year’s questions on performance.
- **Key Drivers of Performance:** Identify the most significant factors influencing the performance index using feature analysis.
- **Patterns and Trends:** Discover patterns in student behaviors, such as the impact of balanced habits on performance.

## Project Goals

### 1. Develop a Predictive Model
- Build a robust machine learning model that accurately predicts the student performance index based on historical data.
- Explore and experiment with various algorithms to identify the most effective model for the specific dataset.

### 2. Feature Analysis and Selection
- Conduct a thorough analysis of features to identify those with the highest impact on the performance index.

### 3. Data Preprocessing
- Cleanse and preprocess the dataset to handle missing values, outliers, and ensure data quality.

### 4. Model Evaluation and Validation
- Employ rigorous validation techniques to assess the performance and generalization capability of the model.
- Utilize metrics such as **R² Score**, **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**, and **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)** to evaluate the model's effectiveness in predicting the performance index.

## Insights

- **Impact of Study Hours:**  
  Analyze how the number of hours studied correlates with the performance index and identify optimal study hours. This can help determine if more study hours consistently lead to higher performance or if diminishing returns occur after a certain threshold.

- **Importance of Practice:**  
  Examine the relationship between the number of sample paper questions solved and the performance index. It could reveal whether more practice questions directly contribute to better performance outcomes.

- **Role of Extracurricular Activities:**  
  Investigate whether extracurricular activities positively or negatively influence the performance index. This insight may suggest the importance of balancing academics with other activities to enhance overall performance.

- **Effect of Sleep Hours:**  
  Study how the average number of hours a student sleeps affects their academic performance. Insights here can help highlight the critical role of proper rest for optimal cognitive function and performance.

- **Significance of PYQ Scores:**  
  Evaluate how performance on previous year’s question papers influences the performance index. This may reveal if familiarity with past exam patterns plays a significant role in academic success.

- **Key Drivers of Performance:**  
  Use feature importance or correlation analysis to identify the most impactful factors (such as study hours, sleep, or practice) that drive the performance index. These insights can guide students and educators on where to focus efforts for improvement.

- **Patterns and Trends:**  
  Discover patterns in student behaviors, such as the effect of balanced study habits (study hours, sleep, and practice) on performance. Identifying these trends can help in creating more effective study strategies and educational practices.
